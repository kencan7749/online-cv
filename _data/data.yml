        I worked on developing voice conversion methods. 
        I tried to convert speech into a voice that matches an input face image and generates a face image that matches the voice of the input speech by Deep neural network. 
        My work was just preliminary but this project was submitted to arXiv ("Crossmodal Voice Conversion" https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04540)

      I implemtent the tool for generating image/video that increases the DNN unit's activity value.
      The code is available on the Github (linked below). I also upload these image on Instagram everyday.
